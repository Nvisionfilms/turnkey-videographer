# TURNKEY — IDENTITY GOVERNANCE FORMULA

---

## 🔒 Identity Enforcement Rule

Before writing copy, designing UI, or shipping a feature, reference this document.

If the change introduces:
- Motivation
- Confidence-building
- "Know your worth" language
- Encouragement, reassurance, or praise

**It must be rewritten or rejected.**

TurnKey does not improve how users feel about pricing.
It improves what they are able to see.

---

## DECISION FILTER (THE ACTUAL FORMULA)

Every decision must pass all 5 checks.
If it fails any one, it does not ship.

### 1. BEHAVIOR CHECK

**Question:**
What behavior does this make visible that was previously invisible?

**Passes if:**
- It records a decision
- It preserves history
- It prevents forgetting

**Fails if:**
- It only "helps"
- It only speeds things up
- It exists for convenience alone

### 2. MEMORY CHECK

**Question:**
Does this still matter 30 days later?

**Passes if:**
- It contributes to a ledger
- It compounds over time
- It changes what the user can reference later

**Fails if:**
- It only exists in the moment
- It disappears after interaction
- It creates instant feedback or insight

### 3. LANGUAGE CHECK

**Question:**
Could this sentence appear on a SaaS landing page?

If yes, rewrite it.

**Approved language sounds like:**
- A contract
- A ledger
- A system record
- An accounting note

**Banned language includes:**
- "You should"
- "You deserve"
- "Know your worth"
- "Build confidence"
- "Feel empowered"

### 4. PRESSURE ORDER CHECK

**Question:**
Is this defined before the client exists?

**Passes if:**
- It sets constraints early
- It locks boundaries before negotiation
- It reinforces "this was set before pressure"

**Fails if:**
- It reacts to negotiation
- It adapts to discomfort
- It exists to soften pressure

### 5. LEDGER TEST

**Final test:**
Does this feel like a ledger or a dashboard?

**Ledger = correct**
- Counts
- Totals
- Time-bounded records
- Neutral statements

**Dashboard = reject**
- Performance framing
- Trends with interpretation
- Positive/negative judgment
- Visual celebration or warning

---

## MANDATORY REWRITE TRIGGERS

If any of the following appear, the content is automatically flagged for rewrite:

- Confidence
- Worth
- Motivation
- Encouragement
- Empowerment
- Hustle
- Wins / losses
- Success language

TurnKey does not interpret outcomes.
It records them.

---

## NAMING LOCK (PREVENTS DRIFT)

Use these words. Do not invent new ones.

| Concept | Locked Term |
|---------|-------------|
| User history | Pricing Ledger |
| Behavior tracking | Recorded Decisions |
| Price movement | Trade-offs |
| Minimum | Floor |
| Final price | Decision |
| Target | Intent |
| Summary | This Month / Previous |
| Behavior section | Ledger (never "dashboard") |

If a new label is needed, it must:
- Be noun-based
- Sound contractual
- Avoid emotion

---

## HOW YOU USE THIS DAY-TO-DAY

| Role | Check |
|------|-------|
| Designers | Language + Ledger tests |
| Developers | Behavior + Memory tests |
| Marketing | Language + Pressure order |
| Partnerships | What it is NOT |

This isn't branding.
It's operational discipline.

# TURNKEY — CORE IDENTITY

---

## What TurnKey Is

TurnKey is pricing infrastructure for independent videographers.

It records pricing decisions, enforces constraints, and makes patterns visible over time.

It does not motivate.
It does not coach.
It does not tell users what to charge.

**It shows them what they actually do.**

---

## Who TurnKey Is For

TurnKey is for videographers whose work has outgrown intuition.

People who:
- Quote real projects, not hypotheticals
- Carry responsibility for outcomes, not just delivery
- Feel pressure to negotiate without forgetting their own constraints

If someone only wants a quick number, a spreadsheet, or "industry rates,"
TurnKey is not for them.

---

## The Core Problem

Most pricing tools fail because they focus on calculation, not memory.

People don't undercharge because they can't do math.
They undercharge because they renegotiate themselves in isolation.

**TurnKey exists to remove that isolation.**

---

## The Core Promise

**See what your pricing decisions actually cost.**

Before the client.
During the quote.
After the export.

Nothing more. Nothing less.

---

## What TurnKey Refuses to Be

- A motivational product
- A confidence product
- A "know your worth" product
- A coaching system
- A marketplace or rate card

Any feature that pushes TurnKey toward those directions is out of scope.

---

# TURNKEY — PRODUCT DOCTRINE

These are non-negotiable rules.
If something violates these, it does not ship.

---

## Doctrine 1: Visibility Over Advice

TurnKey never tells the user what they should do.

It shows:
- Floors
- Intent
- Decisions
- Outcomes
- History

Any sentence that sounds like advice, encouragement, or correction is removed.

If insight requires interpretation, TurnKey stays silent.

---

## Doctrine 2: Memory Is the Product

The calculator is not the product.
The export is not the product.

**Recorded decisions over time are the product.**

That means:
- No behavior is tracked without an export
- No patterns without sufficient history
- No "insights" that appear instantly

If it doesn't require time to reveal, it doesn't belong.

---

## Doctrine 3: Constraints Come Before Pressure

Every important boundary must exist before the client exists.

Examples:
- Floor is calculated before negotiation
- Intent is defined before compromise
- Scope is defined before add-ons
- Complexity is named before pricing shifts

The UI must always reinforce:
**"This was set before pressure."**

---

## Doctrine 4: Silent Ledger, Not Dashboard

Behavioral sections are records, not reports.

**Allowed:**
- Counts
- Totals
- Simple comparisons
- Time-bound summaries

**Not allowed:**
- Percent judgments
- Performance language
- Trend arrows
- Positive or negative framing

If it feels like a dashboard, it's wrong.
If it feels like a ledger, it's right.

---

## Doctrine 5: Language Must Carry Authority, Not Emotion

All copy must sound like:
- A contract
- A ledger
- A system of record

**Not allowed:**
- Inspiration
- Guilt
- Praise
- Shame
- Hustle language
- Creator hype

If a sentence could appear on a generic SaaS landing page, it is rewritten.

---

## Doctrine 6: Pricing Is a Discipline, Not a Personality

TurnKey does not adapt to who the user is.

It adapts to:
- Scope
- Responsibility
- Complexity
- Constraints

**No features based on:**
- Confidence level
- Experience ego
- Aspirational identity

The system respects behavior, not self-image.

---

## Doctrine 7: Manual Control Beats Automation When Money Is Involved

Some things stay manual on purpose:
- Affiliate payouts
- Refund reviews
- Edge cases

This reinforces:
- Accountability
- Intentionality
- Trust in the system

If automation removes reflection, it is a regression.

---

## Doctrine 8: Fewer Numbers, Higher Weight

More numbers ≠ more clarity.

Prefer:
- 4-line totals over detailed breakdowns
- Named totals over itemized persuasion
- Locked summaries over adjustable widgets

If a number exists, it must matter.

---

## Doctrine 9: No Feature Exists Without Behavioral Consequence

Every feature must answer:
**"What behavior does this make visible or harder to avoid?"**

If the answer is "convenience only," it does not ship.

---

## Doctrine 10: Drift Is the Enemy

Any future addition must be checked against:
- Core Identity
- These doctrines
- Existing language patterns

If it introduces:
- Coaching
- Motivation
- Gamification
- Emotional framing

It is rejected or rewritten.

---

# WHAT TURNKEY IS NOT

---

## Not a Motivation Tool

- Not here to boost confidence
- Not here to tell users they're "worth more"
- Not here to push mindset shifts or affirmations

If someone needs motivation, TurnKey stays silent.

---

## Not Coaching Software

- No "you should charge more"
- No advice
- No recommendations framed as guidance
- No corrective language

TurnKey does not teach behavior.
It records it.

---

## Not a Rate Card

- No industry averages
- No preset "fair prices"
- No copying other people's numbers

Every price comes from the user's own inputs and constraints.

---

## Not a Marketplace

- No leads
- No exposure
- No discovery
- No client matching

TurnKey does not promise work.
It only governs decisions.

---

## Not a Gamified SaaS

- No streaks
- No badges
- No progress bars
- No "wins" or "losses"
- No performance scoring

If it feels like a game, it's wrong.

---

## Not a Spreadsheet Replacement

- Not built for quick math
- Not optimized for speed alone
- Not designed to be disposable

Spreadsheets calculate.
TurnKey remembers.

---

## Not a Freelancer Ego Tool

- Not about status
- Not about seniority
- Not about "leveling up"

Pricing discipline is not identity-based.

---

## Not a Content Platform

- No courses
- No masterclasses
- No tutorials
- No influencer layer

TurnKey does not teach filmmaking.
It does not teach business.

---

## Not Automation for Its Own Sake

- No auto-pricing
- No AI suggestions
- No hidden optimizations

Every number exists because the user defined it.

---

## Not a Feel-Good Product

- It will not reassure you
- It will not comfort you
- It will not protect you from your own patterns

TurnKey shows reality without commentary.

---

# THE LINE THAT SUMS IT UP

**TurnKey is not here to help you feel better about pricing.
It's here to make sure you can't forget what you did.**

---

# HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

1. Pin it in the repo as `/docs/identity.md`
2. Reference it before:
   - Writing copy
   - Designing UI
   - Adding features
   - Accepting partnerships
3. If a decision feels "off," it's probably violating one doctrine

---

# Final Note

What you've built is not a typical SaaS.

It's closer to:
- Accounting software
- Legal contracts
- Production ledgers

That's why it feels uncomfortable when it drifts toward "confidence" language.

**That discomfort is the signal you're doing it right.**
