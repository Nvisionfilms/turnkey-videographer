# Sync Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

When navigating between the **Setup (Admin)** page and the **Calculator** page, the data was not reflecting changes made in Setup. This was because:

1. The `storage` event listener only fires when localStorage is modified from a **different tab/window**
2. Within the same single-page application (SPA), navigating between pages doesn't trigger the storage event
3. The Calculator page was only loading data once on initial mount

## Solution Implemented

Added automatic data reloading when the Calculator page becomes visible or receives focus:

### Changes Made to `Calculator.jsx`

1. **Refactored data loading into a reusable function**:
   - Created `loadAllData(includeFormData)` function wrapped with `useCallback`
   - This function loads day rates, gear costs, and settings from localStorage
   - The `includeFormData` parameter controls whether to reload the calculator form state

2. **Added visibility change listeners**:
   - Listen for `visibilitychange` event (when tab becomes visible)
   - Listen for `focus` event (when window gains focus)
   - Both events trigger `loadAllData(false)` to reload rates/gear/settings without affecting the form

3. **Preserved existing functionality**:
   - Initial data load on mount still works
   - Storage event listener for cross-tab sync still works
   - Form data auto-save still works

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User edits rates in Setup page
1. User is on Calculator page
2. User navigates to Setup page
3. User edits "Camera op (with camera)" rate from $5000 to $3000
4. User clicks "Save" - data is saved to localStorage
5. User navigates back to Calculator page
6. **NEW**: Page visibility changes, triggering `loadAllData(false)`
7. Calculator automatically reloads rates from localStorage
8. Updated rate ($3000) now appears in Calculator

### Scenario 2: User adds new role in Setup page
1. User is on Setup page
2. User clicks "Add New Rate"
3. User adds "Freelancer" role with rates
4. User clicks "Create" - new role is saved to localStorage
5. User navigates to Calculator page
6. **NEW**: Page visibility changes, triggering `loadAllData(false)`
7. Calculator automatically reloads rates from localStorage
8. "Freelancer" role now appears in Roles & Services section

### Scenario 3: User adds new gear in Setup page
1. User is on Setup page → Gear Costs tab
2. User clicks "Add New Gear"
3. User adds "Slider" with $800 investment
4. User clicks "Create" - new gear is saved to localStorage
5. User navigates to Calculator page
6. **NEW**: Page visibility changes, triggering `loadAllData(false)`
7. Calculator automatically reloads gear from localStorage
8. "Slider" now appears in Gear & Equipment section

## Code Changes

### Before:
```javascript
// Only loaded data once on mount
useEffect(() => {
  // Load data from localStorage
  // ...
}, []);
```

### After:
```javascript
// Reusable function to load data
const loadAllData = useCallback((includeFormData = true) => {
  // Load day rates, gear costs, settings from localStorage
  // Optionally load form data
}, []);

// Load on mount
useEffect(() => {
  loadAllData(true);
  setIsLoading(false);
}, [loadAllData]);

// Reload when page becomes visible
useEffect(() => {
  const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
    if (!document.hidden) {
      loadAllData(false); // Don't reload form data
    }
  };

  const handleFocus = () => {
    loadAllData(false); // Don't reload form data
  };

  document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
  window.addEventListener('focus', handleFocus);
  
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
    window.removeEventListener('focus', handleFocus);
  };
}, [loadAllData]);
```

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Test Role Sync**:
   - Go to Calculator page, note the current rates
   - Navigate to Setup → Day Rates
   - Edit any rate (e.g., change "Director" from $2000 to $2500)
   - Click outside the edit field to save
   - Navigate back to Calculator
   - ✅ Verify the rate shows $2500

2. **Test New Role**:
   - Go to Setup → Day Rates
   - Click "Add New Rate"
   - Add role: "Gaffer", Full Day: $1200
   - Click "Create"
   - Navigate to Calculator
   - ✅ Verify "Gaffer" appears in Roles & Services

3. **Test Gear Sync**:
   - Go to Setup → Gear Costs
   - Edit any gear investment amount
   - Navigate to Calculator
   - ✅ Verify gear amortization updates

4. **Test New Gear**:
   - Go to Setup → Gear Costs
   - Click "Add New Gear"
   - Add item: "Slider", Investment: $800
   - Click "Create"
   - Navigate to Calculator
   - ✅ Verify "Slider" appears in Gear & Equipment

## Benefits

1. **Real-time sync**: Changes in Setup immediately reflect in Calculator
2. **No manual refresh needed**: Users don't need to reload the page
3. **Preserves form state**: Calculator form data is not reset when reloading rates/gear
4. **Cross-tab sync still works**: The existing storage event listener remains functional
5. **Better UX**: Seamless experience when switching between pages

## Technical Notes

- Uses `useCallback` to memoize the `loadAllData` function
- `visibilitychange` event handles tab switching and window minimizing/restoring
- `focus` event handles clicking back into the window
- Form data is only loaded on initial mount, not on visibility changes
- All console logs remain for debugging purposes
